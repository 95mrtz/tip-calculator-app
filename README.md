## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements


### Links

- Live Site URL: [IT'S ALIVE!](https://manuelrtz.github.io/tip-calculator-app/)

## My process

I started building the HTML by separating the two sections, one where the data was entered and one where it was displayed.

I was giving the style, starting with the desktop version, designing one section and then the other, using flexbox (and trying to use GRID, but I chose to use flexbox), using variables in CSS and using media query to make the site responsive.

For functionality use Javascript, separating events and performing the necessary calculations.

It was a one-week challenge, dedicating 1 hour / 1 hour and a half per day.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript
- HTML DOM
